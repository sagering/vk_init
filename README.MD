This library trys to make working with Vulkan a little bit more enjoyable by offering convenient initialiser function to initialise the core Vulkan structures. Using vk_init, you will spend less time on writing and scrolling through repetitive boilerplate.

Take this example:

```
VkDynamicState dynamicState;

...

VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo createInfo;
createInfo.sType = VK_STRUCTURE_TYPE_PIPELINE_DYNAMIC_STATE_CREATE_INFO;
createInfo.pNext = nullptr;
createInfo.flags = 0;
createInfo.dynamicStateCount = 1;
createInfo.pDynamicStates = &dynamicState;

...
```

When working with Vulkan, you usually have to write code similar this hundreds of times, quickly becoming a major pain point.

With vk_init you just need to do this

```
#include "vk_init.h"

...

VkDynamicState dynamicState;

...

VkPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo createInfo = vkiPipelineDynamicStateCreateInfo(1, &dynamicState);

...
```
.

The initialiser functions are not handcrafted but were auto generated by a python script reading in the vulkan_core.h header file. You don't have to worry about incorrect structure types or missing function parameters. Some Vulkan structures have arrays as members. Arrays cannot be passed by value into a function, so you will not find any initialisers for these structs. Don't worry though, there is not many structs of this kind so you might.
